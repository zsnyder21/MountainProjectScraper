# MountainProjectScraper

This project's goal is to scrape mountain project data for area/route/tick information and run statistics on the gathered data

I scraped over 10,000 routes and 90,000 ticks from MountainProject.com and ran statistics on average trad onsight and average sport onsight tick difficulty.
