Another climb worth mentioning is the Return to Forever boulder traverse that runs along the base of the bluff line.

The limestone bluffs rise roughly 180 feet above the river level in some places, though none of the climbs are actually this long. Pretty much everything here is top-rope, with tons of natural anchor options in the trees and some boulders on top of the walls. This limestone can get pretty manky - especially with wet and even just humid weather. There are a few routes that are in bee territory here, which can make the climbing very exciting. Because of the humid and buggy summers, the best time to climb here is October to November. A nice dry crisp fall morning here is ideal.  The favorite section here goes by a few names, but most people know it as \"The Cove\". It is a stone ledge roughly 30 feet by 30 feet behind the dominant Sentinel Tower. Several routes can be found in this small space, easy to moderate, plus a few harder lines. Getting into The Cove requires a class 4 scramble over some well worn holds (smooth as glass) and a few boulders.  Due to the close nature of the routes in The Cove, things can get very crowded here. Overlapping belay stances can be a hassle, but climbers with half a wit and a dose of courtesy shouldn't have any trouble.

From here you should see two house sized boulders, one with a large roof that has foot prints painted on it. From here, the 'grateful fin' is the right side of the next rock formation up the hill, forming a hallway with another short, slabby cliff line. The main cliff line lies maybe one hundred yards left, past another large freestanding block that forms another steeper, slimmer and longer hallway with the main cliff line. Either walk around this boulder or slip through the cave like small corridor at the end of the hallway, which will pop you out to the main cliff line.

It has, however, received quite a bit of notoriety due to a handful of hard classics that have been established here such as Chuck Norris (V9), Ring of Fire (V10), Eternal Sunshine (V9), Year of the Renegade (V12), Beaver Eater Delux (V8) and The Gobbler (aka Illinois biggest sloper) (V8) amongst others.  The rock quality ranges from perfect to mediocre with it usually improving as the grade rises.  The Roost is mostly a somewhat broken and usually very steep cliff line that goes on for maybe 150 yards along with a handful of free standing boulders that all sit in quiet woods next to a serene lake.  There are maybe 40 or so established problems here with some projects and possibilities for more.  I am not including any specifics for problems because I don't have any pictures and when I've been I just climb what looks fun or attempt what I have scene in videos.  I encourage you to do the same or better yet buy and reference Matt Bliss's awesome guidebook \"Sandstone Warrior\" documenting problems at The Roost, Jackson Falls bouldering, Elephant Rocks SP, Giant City SP, The Beach and many more bouldering areas in southern Illinois.","GettingThere":"To find The Roost you must first get to Jackson Falls.     To do this head south down I-24 until you can exit onto HWY 45 and head northeast until you reach the town of Ozark.  At the Ozark General Store take a right (east) down Ozark Road for approximately 4.5 miles until you make a sharp left curve at Zion Church/Cemetery.  Then make a right after a couple hundred yards onto Trigg Tower Road (which is gravel) (please drive slowly down this road as you pass a house and there are many blind spots you could easily smash into another climber coming out - it wouldn't be the first time).  After two miles of this you will come upon the main parking area for Jackson Falls.  Keep driving past this for another mile or so passing pull offs and many great, free camping spots and the dog walk for Jackson.    After you pass through Jackson the last main camping area is The Pines (please don't park here), across from this is a somewhat open field.  Park immediately after this on the right and follow the four wheeler trail into the woods.  Follow the trail - it will fork a few times but ends up reconnecting in the end.  You will come to a small creek that crosses the trail and a rock cairn.  Turn left here and follow it along the creek for a few minutes.  The trail will soon start dropping and boulders and the lake will come into view.","URL":"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/107017143/the-roost"}

The wall was built to support the Union Pacific train line, formerly known as the Chicago-Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, which was established in the 1850s. It\u2019s unclear when the wall was constructed. Similarly, the composition of rock is unknown (research is underway).The wall is composed of several traverse \u201croutes\u201d. Streets heading north-south provide natural break points for each route along the Union Pacific Crag. Generally speaking, the rock quality is questionable, however with a bit of pulling loose rock away by hand, toothbrush maintenance, and cleaning summer weeds with a machete, stellar bouldering problems and quite stable rock can be revealed. In most sections the top of the wall is lined with metal posts; the approximate distance between each post is 10 ft. This makes it easy to estimate the length of each traverse as well as break each route down into 10-20\u2019 sectors so that it is easier to keep track of progress and mark cruxes along your journey.The first known ascent of a route at this crag was on Wednesday, July 29 2020 by Brian T.
