THAT in their mind was related to the use of cliffs for anything vertical. Senseless. But climbing had not yet become a widely known indoor sport back then; no X Games, no MTV or action sports media, so nothing for them to relate to except guys who fall off cliffs with coolers full of beer. We wrote letters, made calls, had a meeting, explained our simple use, clean climbing, no pitons, toprope mostly, etc..and they still said NO. This was long before the Access Fund got started to the degree it is today. Chalk was not an issue, as it was the same substance and color as the dusty calcium carbonate limestone rocks. Fishermen leave bait containers and trash, and hike down the same rugged cliff trail that we do,but they get to stay. (they pay for stuff, we didn't; so go figure) Trespass and you would get your gear taken away plus a fine. Since then, with the lack of climbing traffic on the cliffs, there is a major increase of plants on the blocky rocks. Many holds are gone from dirt and invasive plant roots prying them off the walls. Hard to believe we were safer than nature turns out to be.","CommentTime":"Nov 25, 2009","BetaVotes":0,"AdditionalInfo":null}

First, please don't park parallel to the highway at the gravel pull-off parking area. Many more cars (and thus, climbers!) will be able to safely get to the crag if we park perpendicular to the road in this area. Second, when my crew and I were there this past weekend we noticed two pieces of gnarly metal poking out of the ground, right next to each other, in the center of the parking area. Beware! This stuff will surely cause a flat tire eventually. I should be going back to the bluffs in the next week or two and I'll take a sledge hammer to flatten this stuff.

Once you reach the tracks head south down them until you see a cliff line on your right/west (maybe 1/2 mile). Stay on the tracks until the cliff line starts to recede further west away from you. As this happens watch for the \"marker boulder\" (a lone boulder sitting by itself in between the tracks and the cliff). As you see this watch for a foot path and take it. This will lead you to the boulder and then to the cliff. You are now in the Promise Land. The Promise Land has another 50 or so routes to add to the rest of the beautiful routes at Jackson Falls. The concentration of five star routes here is astonishing! Some of the best looking walls in the Midwest are here. There are a handful of easier routes but this area is best suited for the 5.12 climber.

A couple of easy ones were led, but the rest that saw leads were more one-time 'exhibition' leads and could just have easily been free solos at the time. In fact, the cliff originally saw way more free solos than gear leads. The challenge of leading these routes came way after the fact by decades and to some extent still remain more a high-end novelty. Another note is none of these routes were put up or climbed with chalk which isn't necessary and destroys the 'puzzle' aspect of figuring out these routes and make no mistake, the puzzle factor was half the fun of the place and just seeing the routes at all to do the FAs was as much a challenge as actually doing them. David Hug, the administrator here, has done a lot of these bold new leads and has amended the ratings here to reflect that. But please don't let the r/x ratings here dissuade you from climbing these routes - just TR them as they were originally done. In the process you may find that might not be as easy as your typical over-hung sport route as on TR you're either climbing or flying - there's no hanging to sort out the details. It should also be noted that all these Giant City routes represent the well-spring of the skills that went on to develop Drapers and Jackson Falls - if you ever get curious about where the developers of those areas cut their teeth then this is the place to come.","CommentTime":"Sep 20, 2016","BetaVotes":1,"AdditionalInfo":null}

Many ice climbs were done before that on the sly I've been told. At the start, we had access to any kind of ice we could find, in numerous canyons. Due to changes in park regulations and removal of many key trails, staircases and bridges, all the other canyons are closed now to climbing. Only LaSalle, Ottowa, Tonti, Wildcat and French are left. Most have only one formation in the canyon. Hennepin, Kickapoo, Sac, Aurora, Pontiac, Lone Tree, Basswood Canyons are locations of other ice formations. Illinois Canyon is still closed to climbing, and had up to 6 ice formations there with names like Warbonnet, Chief Illiniwek, Indian Princess, the Arrow, etc. It was a popular destination until the trails and stairs were removed during the 'boardwalk' building phase the park went through in the late 90s.

Over the last two weeks I got a chance get on just about everything that was legal. It has been my impression that this has been a good year for ice here, we got on The Virgin which apparently rarely comes in and the right pillar at Ottawa Canyon, which is rare as well?","CommentTime":"Feb 28, 2010","BetaVotes":0,"AdditionalInfo":null}

You never know how the flow will go for water runoff. I'm sure there are some other rare formations in too, but they are all illegal to climb these days. But since I'm seeing 8 or 10 sign-in's for 'Wildcat' yet only 4 bodies, I'm guessing there is some illegal access taking place unannounced. I envy them, but fear the consequences if someone gets caught. Kudos on the Virgin and the also rare Ottowa right side. Haven't seen that one since the 80's for sure.","CommentTime":"Mar 1, 2010","BetaVotes":0,"AdditionalInfo":null}

Hah- we're experience mountaineers!\" I can remember sketchy mantel upon sketchy mantel on icy, snow covered, rounded sandstone bulges WAY above the river with ice floes banging ominously on the dam gates below. Of course we wouldn't rope up on what had been a summer hiking trail. Of course we were way off route in the snow. Second coldest I've ever been- Starved Rock climbing LaSalle. The end of my pick broke off about halfway up. Top-quality Welsh metallurgy- a Curver axe from the early 80's- better for bar fights than steep ice. Great days indeed!","CommentTime":"Apr 6, 2010","BetaVotes":0,"AdditionalInfo":null}

Since this is private land and there is not direct permission from landowners allowing climbing, it is best to remove this info and avoid further climbing in the area.","CommentTime":"Mar 9, 2021","BetaVotes":0,"AdditionalInfo":null}

The location in MP was estimated by overlaying the map area (mountainproject.com/photo/1\u2026) from the guidebook over google maps. The roads and such in the guidebook don't line up perfectly, and the area is just indicated by an arrow, so right now, the map location is a best-guess, and needs improvement. I'll take a look in the guidebook tonight to see if I can get you some better beta, but I think this was supposed to be a short approach from the road. If you're able to find it (or any of the other recently-added walls, for that matter), let me know, and I can update with a better location, etc.","CommentTime":"Oct 2, 2018","BetaVotes":1,"AdditionalInfo":null}

Bolts look pretty old but solid with chains one pitch up (inspecting from the ground, mind you) and must be at least a moderate - hard enough that someone left a bail biner. Not sure there are any other sport routes in the whole park, so I find this interesting! Mosquitos and gnats can get bad during hatches in the summer, but go in late fall or early spring and it's paradise.","CommentTime":"Nov 4, 2018","BetaVotes":1,"AdditionalInfo":null}
